// This class provides a way to do audio processing that does not need
// to be executed in real-time. For example, broadcast encoding
// and recording encoding can be done here. This class uses double-buffering
// to increase the amount of time the CPU has to do whatever work needs to
// be done, and that work is executed in a separate thread. (Threading
// allows the next buffer to be filled while processing a buffer that's is
// already full.)
